About NoseDjango
================

NoseDjango is a plugin for running unit tests of a Django application
with `nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>_`.

NoseDjango is originally developed by Jason Pellerin, later adopted by
Victor Ng and nowdays maintained and developed by Jyrki Pulliainen.

Motivation behind NoseDjango
----------------------------

The motivation behind NoseDjango is the ease of testing. NoseDjango
enables the developer to write the tests in the unobtrusive manner, as
`described by nose
<http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.1/testing.html>_`
without the overhead of different unit test frameworks. So no need to
create TestSuites or classes for single test cases, unless, of course,
the developer wants to.

NoseDjango of course supports existing Django unit test framework and
the tests written with it get run by NoseDjango too.
